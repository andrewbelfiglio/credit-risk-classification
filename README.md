# credit-risk-classification

### This project is an assignment in the Data Science and Data Visualizations bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with edX.

### This repository contains an .ipynb file which employs supervised machine learning models (with logistic regression) to classify loans as "healthy" or "high risk". The data is found in the Resources folder. The report.md file provides additional details on the data, the analyses completed, and a summary of the results.

### This code is original and is based on the curriculum of the bootcamp program.
